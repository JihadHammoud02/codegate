# CodeGate docs

This folder contains Mermaid-based diagrams describing how CodeGate works.

## Diagrams

- `sequence-diagram.md` — sequence diagram for `codegate run` (CLI → contract → Runner → Docker → rules)
- `directory-structure.md` — directory tree and module relationships
- `class-diagram-rules.md` — class diagram for rules (and their interaction with `Runner`/`DockerRunner`)

## Viewing

GitHub renders Mermaid diagrams in Markdown automatically.

In VS Code, install a Mermaid preview extension (optional) and open the `.md` files.
